shpak 1.X
=========

**shpak** is a general purpose shell library package intended for 
hardcore bash users. It is not perfect nor optimal, it is just 
my collection of useful bash functions I use everyday on some 
machines. It sports a simple library mechnism to load functions 
on the-fly.


Example shpak script
====================
#!/bin/bash
. $(dirname ${0})/../lib/h.sh
sp_f_load gui/scr
sp_f_stt "Select screen"
sp_f_scr

Install
=======
1. Clone the github repo to your $HOME
2. Put $HOME/shapk/bin to $PATH
